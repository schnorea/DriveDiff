  - Independent scan paths, exclusion patterns, and settings for each comparison type
  - Dedicated configuration tabs in the configuration dialog
  - Specialized optimization for different comparison modes

- **Intelligent Mounted Volume Support**: Enhanced path matching for mounted filesystems
  - Automatic path normalization (e.g., `/Volumes/rootfs/usr/share` matches `/usr/share` exclusions)
  - Cross-platform mounted volume handling
  - Smart exclusion pattern matching for mounted paths

- **Enhanced Configuration Dialog**: Completely redesigned configuration interface
  - üìÅ Directory Comparison tab: Full file content comparison settings
  - üå≥ Structure Comparison tab: Directory structure analysis settings  
  - ‚ö° Performance tab: Threading and optimization controls
  - üîß Advanced tab: Raw YAML editor with validation

- **Configuration Management**: Improved configuration handling
  - Load/Save configuration files with proper YAML display
  - Real-time configuration validation
  - Import/Export configuration presets
  - Separate performance tuning for each comparison type

### Changed
- **Configuration Structure**: Migrated from single to dual configuration sections
  - `directory_comparison` section for full file content analysis

  - Improved performance settings with per-mode optimization

- **Path Exclusion Logic**: Enhanced exclusion pattern matching
  - Better handling of complex directory structures
  - Improved mounted volume path resolution
  - More intelligent pattern matching algorithms

### Fixed
- **Configuration Loading**: Fixed issue where "Load Config..." button wasn't updating YAML editor
- **Path Matching**: Resolved mounted volume exclusion issues for complex paths
- **Memory Management**: Improved configuration handling to prevent memory leaks

### Removed
- **Legacy Configuration Support**: Cleaned up legacy configuration patterns

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added
- **Tabbed Interface**: New tabbed UI with dedicated tabs for Content and Structure comparisons
- **Enhanced Structure Tree**: Specialized color-coded hierarchical tree view for directory structure
  - Green for added directories
  - Red for removed directories  
  - Blue for common directories
  - Intuitive hierarchical navigation
  - Interactive legend and summary statistics

### Changed
- **UI Redesign**: Major interface overhaul with separate tabs for different comparison types
- **Structure Comparison**: Moved to dedicated tab with specialized visualization
- **Navigation**: Improved directory structure navigation with expandable tree view

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-27

### Changed
- **Directory Structure Comparison**: Improved to focus only on directory structure, not individual files
  - Now scans only directories for true structural comparison
  - Faster and more focused on actual directory tree differences
  - Removes file-level noise for cleaner structural analysis

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added
- **Directory Structure Comparison**: New "Compare Structure" button for fast directory tree analysis
  - Lightweight comparison focusing only on directory structure and existence
  - No file content hashing or analysis for maximum speed
  - Perfect for quickly identifying structural changes between directories
  - Separate progress tracking and completion callbacks
  - Results displayed in existing tree view with clear status indicators

### Technical Details
- New `StructureComparison` dataclass for structure-only results
- `compare_structure()` and `compare_structure_async()` methods in DirectoryScanner
- Enhanced UI with dual comparison modes (Structure + Full Content)
- Shared cancellation mechanism for both comparison types
- Backward compatible with existing comparison functionality

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-27

### Added
