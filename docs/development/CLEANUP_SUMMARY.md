## Configuration System Cleanup Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

**1. Removed Legacy Path Support**
- Eliminated the unnecessary "Legacy Paths" tab from configuration dialog
- Removed legacy `paths` section from default YAML configuration
- Cleaned up `_load_configuration()` method to only handle dual configs
- Updated `_build_config_from_form()` to generate clean dual structure
- Removed all legacy event handler methods (`_browse_scan_path`, `_add_exclude_path`, etc.)

**2. Streamlined Configuration Structure**
- Configuration now has only essential sections:
  - `logging`: Shared logging configuration
  - `directory_comparison`: File content comparison configuration  
  - `structure_comparison`: Directory structure analysis configuration
  - `performance`: Shared performance settings
- No more confusing legacy `paths` section

**3. Simplified GUI**
- Configuration dialog now has focused tabs:
  - üìÅ **Directory Comparison** - For file content analysis exclusions
  - üå≥ **Structure Comparison** - For directory structure exclusions  
  - **Performance** - Threading and processing settings
  - **Advanced** - Raw YAML editing and validation
- Removed unnecessary "Legacy Paths" tab

**4. Clean Documentation**
- Updated PATH_EXCLUSION_FEATURE.md to reflect simplified structure
- Removed references to legacy support and migration
- Clarified that this is a new implementation without backward compatibility needs

### üéØ System Benefits

- Only two focused configuration types instead of three
- Clear separation between file content and structure analysis
- No confusing legacy options

**Better Performance**  
- Cleaner configuration loading and processing

### üß™ Test Results

All functionality tests pass:
- ‚úÖ Configuration loading works correctly
- ‚úÖ DirectoryScanner creation for both comparison types
- ‚úÖ Dual configuration system fully functional  
- ‚úÖ Configuration dialog creates and loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Clean YAML structure generation

The system is now streamlined and production-ready without any legacy baggage!
