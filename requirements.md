# SD Card Comparison Tool Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The SD Card Comparison Tool is a GUI-based application designed to compare contents between two SD card mount points, providing detailed file and directory comparison capabilities.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Mount Point Selection
- Provide GUI interface with two browse buttons for selecting SD card mount points
- Support Paragon extfs mounted directories
- Validate selected paths exist and are accessible

### 2.2 Directory Comparison
- Compare contents of selected directories
- Display:
  - Added files
  - Removed files
  - Modified files
- Implement tree view navigation of differences
- Show progress bar for large directory comparisons
